# Detecting-Android-Malware-Applications-using-Data-Mining-Techniques

This last decade has seen the rise of mobile devices, which have become integral to modern society and helped shape the landscape of mobile information access. However, security concerns expand drastically along with these fast improvements in modern mobile devices, with malware being the most worrisome of them. Android has cornered a sizable chunk of the market for mobile apps. The exponential growth of malware has necessitated the employment of machine learning (ML) algorithms for the categorisation of files into harmful and legitimate categories. Thus, numerous research and studies are still on the rise in this field, with a focus on applying ML techniques to the problem of malware detection (MD) and mitigation. This research aims to build on the foundation laid by previous works by offering a static base classification technique for MD based on android permissions & API calls. The goal of this method is to achieve high MD rates and contribute to the efforts and studies in protecting the development of mobile information by applying three popular ML algorithms (Voting classifier, LGBM, Decision Tree (DT), Extra Tree (ET), Random forest (RF), and XGboost) to a comprehensive new Android malware dataset (CIC InvesAndMal2019). Multiple ML methods have been employed to categorize Android malware apps. The acquired findings show that our suggested method is both efficient and accurate, with a 97% accuracy compared to existing ML classifiers. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of our technology as a way of detecting Android malware.
